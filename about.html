                        Maple Brew Coffee was born from a simple dream: to create a place where the community could gather, connect, and find comfort in a perfect cup of coffee. Founded in 2018 by Sarah and James Mitchell, two lifelong residents of our small town, the café began as a labor of love in a historic building that had stood empty for years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What started as a weekend renovation project quickly became a passion. Sarah, a former teacher with a love for baking, and James, a coffee enthusiast who had traveled the world studying coffee culture, combined their skills to create something truly special. They wanted a place that felt like home—where neighbors could catch up over morning coffee, students could study in cozy corners, and families could gather for weekend treats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The name "Maple Brew" pays homage to the beautiful maple trees that line our town's streets, especially stunning in autumn when their leaves turn brilliant shades of orange, red, and gold. Just like those trees, we wanted our café to be a constant, comforting presence in the community—a place that changes with the seasons but always feels familiar.

                    <h3>🏡 Small-Town Roots</h3>
                    <p>We're not just in the community—we're of the community. Our family has lived here for generations, and we understand what makes our town special. Every decision we make is guided by our commitment to preserving the character and warmth of small-town life.</p>

                    <h3>🌱 Local Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>We work directly with local farmers, bakers, and artisans. Our milk comes from a dairy farm just 15 miles away, our maple syrup from a family-run operation in the next town over, and our seasonal produce from nearby farms. When you support us, you're supporting the entire local economy.</p>

                    <h3>👥 Personal Relationships</h3>
                    <p>We know our customers by name, remember their favorite orders, and celebrate their milestones. Whether it's a student's first day of college, a new parent's first outing, or a regular's birthday, we're here to share in life's moments, big and small.</p>

                    <h3>🎨 Handcrafted Everything</h3>
                    <p>Nothing here is mass-produced. Our syrups are made in-house, our pastries are baked fresh each morning, and our coffee is roasted in small batches to ensure peak flavor. We believe that the best things in life take time and care.</p>
